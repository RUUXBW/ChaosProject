## Abstract

Accurate and high-performance massive destruction simulations have become increasingly popular today. With the newly released Chaos Destruction Physics System from Epic, developers are capable of achieving cinematic-quality visuals in real-time in scenes with massive-scale levels of destruction. 

In this work, we are interested in seeing how the Chaos physics system can be applied to traditional game development workflow in Unreal Engine. We created a space-setting scene that demonstrated the aesthetic and robustness of massive destruction using Chaos. Furthermore, we expanded the scene and integrated it with the new Niagara Particle System and created a visually exciting scenario cinematic clips using Unreal Engine 4.23.
